# GeoFS-Addon-Chat

This is a fully functioning addon chat system for GeoFS. It was created as a method of communication in-game for a smaller community wishing to escape the toxicity and MRP of the main chat, as well as the sheer number of users on the main chat.

The code is provided in both console-injectable and bookmarklet format. To run this as a bookmarklet, you follow the following procedure:
- Copy the code
- Click the little star icon at the right end of your search bar to make a bookmark
- Click "more"
- Type "GeoFS Addon Chat" in the "Name" box
- Paste the code into the "URL" space
- Click "save"
- Click the bookmark when running GeoFS to run it. 

Note: this is NOT compatible with other addons that use this style of UI (at least not yet).

If the bookmarks bar is not visible when playing GeoFS, right click any bookmark and click "Show bookmarks bar" at the very bottom of the popup menu.

There are a number of other GeoFS addons that can be run as bookmarklets, so it is recommended to make a bookmarks folder of GeoFS addons if you are planning on using multiple of them.
